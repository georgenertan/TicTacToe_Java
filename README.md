# TicTacToe_Java
  From de beginning, I want to say, that this is my first project, and was made using what I learned so far.
  The game can be played by 1 player(playing with the computer), or 2 players(playing with another person). For this, 
in the Game Class we have the method getInfo. In this method, a command is read, using the Scanner Class. The command 
has to be:1 or 2(number of players).
  Next we need a board to play on. The GamBoard Class contains a two dimensional array, named "board", with a size of 
3X3. This array has 9 cells, and a cell can have the following values:X, O, EMPTY. This values are store in the Cell Enum.
